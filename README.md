## CS225B: Robot Programming Laboratory

This repository contains the source code for CS225B, taught at Stanford in Fall 2011.  The course focuses on implementing a large part of the ROS Navigation stack (http://wiki.ros.org/navigation) on the Turtlebot robot over the course of 4 projects. I co-wrote the source code with Drew Schmitt.

To summarize:

   Project 1: ROS basics
   Project 2: trajectory planning
   Project 3: amcl (localization)
   Project 4: GraphSLAM	

Note the code was written for ROS Electric and does not use the current catkin build system; it is mostly here for reference.  I may port it in the future.
